## Icons optimization
When adding icons to your page, you might consider some optimization steps:
- If you need icons like `arrow left` or `arrow right`, you might want to take one icon and use the CSS to rotate the icon in the direction you need. This way, you can have one icon for various directions
- When you need to load various icons, check out some applications like [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io). This app can merge various icons into one font. It can improve page performance because there are fewer requests. Also, the font is more flexible than embedding a link to each icon
- Icons should be in the SVG format. Try to avoid JPG or PNG. It is because SVG size can be changed easily without getting blurred.
- If the icon is a direct path but can be lazyloaded, you should add the `loading="lazy"` and the `decoding="async"` attribute. This allows the browser to continue rendering the page and decode images asynchronously.
