## Images optimization
When loading various images on page, try following optimization tricks:
- If the image should be loaded immediately, use `fetchpriority="high"` attribute. Otherwise use `loading="lazy"`. This will decrease the amount of images loaded when the customer enters the page.
- Use correct size. If the block size is for example 400x200, do not load image 2000x1000
- For images, that are large on desktop, try to split the image into smaller pieces and load it using `<picture>` element.
