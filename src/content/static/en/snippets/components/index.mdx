Stylify components are inspired by the [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/).
Stylify doesn't provide any color palettes by default, because prepared color palettes mostly doesn't match project needs and are changed anyway.

However we have a guide on how to use theme and color palettes generated by the [Material Theme Builder](/en/snippets/snippets/material-theme).

Components' proportions are taken from their [community figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/DJMWYdOn4HyZ9GQqrGZfXD/Material-3-Design-Kit-(Community)?node-id=47909%3A2).

<Note>Components expect that you have some kind of a "reset" stylesheet included in your page.
For example [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
Also the `box-sizing:border-box` should be added on all elements.</Note>
