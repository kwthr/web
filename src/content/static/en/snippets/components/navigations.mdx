	description="This is a simple navigation. When the navigation doesn't have enough space (on mobile for example) the overflow indicators with white gradient (on right and left side) shows up to signalize that the menu is scrollable. In case you don't want those indicators, you can remove them. Don't forget to remove the javascript and CSS for them too. If there is any active item in the menu, it automatically scrolls into the view."
