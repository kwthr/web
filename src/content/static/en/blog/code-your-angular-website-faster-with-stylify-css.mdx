Style your Angular app quickly and easily with [Stylify CSS](/). Split CSS for large pages or create one bundle for a whole app and get extremely small CSS.

## Introduction
[Stylify](/) is a library that uses CSS-like selectors to generate optimized utility-first CSS based on what you write.

- ‚úÖ CSS-like selectors
- ‚úÖ No framework to study
- ‚úÖ Less time spent in docs
- ‚úÖ Mangled & Extremely small CSS
- ‚úÖ No CSS purge needed
- ‚úÖ Components, Variables, Custom selectors
- ‚úÖ It can generate multiple CSS bundles

Also we have a page about [what problems Stylify CSS solves and why you should give it a try!](/en/docs/get-started/why-stylify-css)

## Installation
First, install the [@stylify/bundler](/en/docs/bundler) package using NPM or Yarn:

```
npm i -D @stylify/bundler
yarn add -D @stylify/bundler
```

Also for the watch mode, we need to run two parallel tasks. This can be solved using concurrently:
```
yarn add -D concurrently
npm i concurrently
```

Next, create a file, for example `stylify.js`:

```javascript
const { Bundler } = require('@stylify/bundler');

const isDev = process.argv[process.argv.length - 1] === '--w';
const bundler = new Bundler({
	watchFiles: isDev,
	// Optional
	compiler: {
		mangleSelectors: !isDev,
		// https://stylifycss.com/en/docs/stylify/compiler#variables
		variables: {},
		// https://stylifycss.com/en/docs/stylify/compiler#macros
		macros: {},
		// https://stylifycss.com/en/docs/stylify/compiler#components
		components: {},
		// ...
	},
});

// This bundles all CSS into one file
// You can configure the Bundler to bundle CSS for each page separately
// See bundler link below
bundler.bundle([
	{
		files: ['./src/**/*.html', './src/**/*.ts'],
		outputFile: './src/styles.css',
	},

	// You can also split CSS for each component
	// You can map files within the components using content comment option
	// https://stylifycss.com/en/docs/bundler#files-content-option
	// Stylify takes that option and searches for defined files. If defined file
	// also has an option, id check also those files and so long.
	// This way it maps all files and all dependencies.
	/*
	{
		files: ['./src/app/app.component.*'],
		outputFile: './src/app/app.component.css',
	},
	*/
]);

```

If you don't define multiple bundles, everything will be bundled into the `styles.css`. If you define multiple bundles, don't forget to add paths to those generated files into Angular components.

The last step is to add scripts into the `package.json`:

```javascript
"scripts": {
	"dev": "concurrently 'yarn stylify.dev' 'ng serve -c development'",
	"prod": "yarn stylify.build & ng serve",
	"stylify.build": "node stylify.js",
	"stylify.dev": "node stylify.js --w"
}
```

In production, you will get optimized CSS and mangled HTML:
```html
<h1 class="font-size:24px color:#dd0031 font-family:arial">
Hello World!
</h1>
```

```css
.a{font-size:24px}
.b{color:#dd0031}
.c{font-family:arial}
```

## Stackblitz Playground
Go ahead and try [Stylify CSS + Angular on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stylifycss-angular-example?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html).

## Configuration
The examples above don't include everything Stylify can do:
- Define [components](/en/docs/stylify/compiler#components)
- Add [custom selectors](/en/docs/stylify/compiler#customselectors)
- Configure [your macros](/en/docs/stylify/compiler#macros) like `ml:20px` for `margin-left`
- Define [custom screens](/en/docs/stylify/compiler#screens)
- You can map [nested files](/en/docs/bundler#files-content-option) in the template
- And a lot more
