<MigrationNote />

## Introduction
Tachyons is a framework that lets you create fast loading, highly readable, and 100% responsive interfaces with as little CSS as possible.

## Selectors and CSS Utilities

<div slot="tool">

Tachyons provides a lot of flexible CSS utilities for properties like color, spacing, typography, visibility, etc:

```html
<div class="flex">
	<div class="outline w-25 pa3 mr2">
		<code>1</code>
	</div>
</div>
```

</div>
<div slot="stylify">

<MigrationStylifySelectors />

</div>
</MigrationCodeBlock>


## Global Selectors

I could not find any information suggesting that Tachyons provides something like dynamic Global Selectors.

## Components

<div slot="tool">

Tachyons doesn't have any configuration API for components.
However, it has a prepared set of copy&paste components on its website you can use in your project and you can configure them in configurator mentioned on their website:

```html
<div class="ph3">
	<h1 class="f6 fw6 ttu tracked">Basic button</h1>
	<a class="f6 link dim ph3 pv2 mb2 dib white bg-black" href="#0">Button Text</a>
</div>

<article class="mw5 mw6-ns center pt4">
	<div class="aspect-ratio aspect-ratio--16x9 mb4">
		<div class="aspect-ratio--object cover"></div>
	</div>
</article>
```

</div>
<div slot="stylify">

<MigrationStylifyComponents />

</div>
</MigrationCodeBlock>

## Configuration, Customization and Variables

<div slot="tool">

Tachyons can be configured directly by modifying downloaded CSS files.
You can also use tachyons with CSS variables and define your own sizes, colors, etc.

They have a video on their website on how to do so.
