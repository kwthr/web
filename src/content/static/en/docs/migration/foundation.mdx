Foundation Sited provides utilities for properties like shadow, flexbox, visibility, etc:

```html
<div class="float-left shadow show-for-medium">Left</div>
```

</div>
<div slot="stylify">

<MigrationStylifySelectors />

## Global Selectors

</MigrationCodeBlock>

## Components
<MigrationCodeBlock image="foundation.png">
<div slot="tool">

Foundation is a framework based on components. Therefore, there are plenty of components, such as buttons, badges, forms, tables, menus, etc:

```html
<span class="badge primary">1</span>
<a role="button" class="button radius primary">1</a>
<ul class="menu">
	<li><a href="#">One</a></li>
	<li><a href="#">Two</a></li>
</ul>
```

</div>
<div slot="stylify">

<MigrationStylifyComponents />

</div>
</MigrationCodeBlock>

## Configuration, Customization and Variables
<MigrationCodeBlock image="foundation.png">
<div slot="tool">

Foundation Sites can be configured within SCSS file. If you downloaded the Foundation directly from their website, you can configure it in `_settings.scss` file, otherwise, you have to override imported variables:

```css
$foundation-palette: (
	"primary": #1779ba,
	"secondary": #767676,
	"success": #3adb76,
	"warning": #ffae00,
	"alert": #cc4b37,
);
```
