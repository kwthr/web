This guide is here to help you quickly compare the features and syntax of the Pure CSS component framework with those of Stylify's utility-first CSS, and give you an idea of how to migrate from Pure CSS to Stylify.

## Introduction
Pure CSS is a set of small, responsive CSS modules that you can use in every web project.

## Selectors and CSS Utilities

<MigrationCodeBlock image="pure-css.png">
<div slot="tool">

Pure CSS provides utilities for properties like grid:
```html
<div class="pure-g">
	<div class="pure-u-1-3"><p>Thirds</p></div>
	<div class="pure-u-1-3"><p>Thirds</p></div>
	<div class="pure-u-1-3"><p>Thirds</p></div>
</div>
```

</div>
<div slot="stylify">

<MigrationStylifySelectors />

</div>
</MigrationCodeBlock>


## Global Selectors

I could not find any information suggesting that Pure CSS provides something like dynamic Global Selectors.

## Components

<div slot="tool">

Pure CSS is a framework that provides some basic components, such as buttons, forms, tables, menus, etc:

```html
<a class="pure-button" href="#">A Pure Button</a>
<table class="pure-table">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>#</th>
			<th>Brand</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>Honda</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
```

</div>
<div slot="stylify">

<MigrationStylifyComponents />

</div>
</MigrationCodeBlock>

## Configuration, Customization and Variables
<MigrationCodeBlock image="pure-css.png">
<div slot="tool">

Pure CSS can be configured by extending existing classes:

```css
/* add your custom styles in this selector */
.form-custom { ... }
```

```html
<form class="form-custom pure-form"></form>
```

You can also choose which components you want to import by selecting responsive and non-responsive Rollup. You can find more info on their website.
