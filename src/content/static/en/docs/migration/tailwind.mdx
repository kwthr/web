## Introduction

Tailwind is a library that helps you rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML. It's a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

	[&>*]:underline
	[&>p]:mt-0
"></div>
```

Components in Tailwind can be defined using `@apply` rule. Also they can be nested into CSS layers:

```css
@layer components {
	.btn-primary {
		@apply py-2 px-4 bg-blue-500 text-white;
	}
}
```

Tailwind also provides a lot of copy&paste components on their website.

	theme: {
		colors: {
			'blue': '#1fb6ff',
		},
		fontFamily: {
			sans: ['Graphik', 'sans-serif'],

		extend: {
			spacing: {
				'8xl': '96rem',
				'9xl': '128rem',
